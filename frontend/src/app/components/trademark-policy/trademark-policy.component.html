    <p i18n="trademark-policy.introduction-text-official" *ngIf="officialMempoolSpace">This Trademark Policy applies to the use of trademarks owned by the B1tpool Project (referred to as "B1tpool",
      "We", or "Us") in relation to the B1tpool software and the <a [href]="env.MEMPOOL_WEBSITE_URL">{{ env.MEMPOOL_WEBSITE_URL }}</a> website (the "Website").</p>
    <p i18n="trademark-policy.introduction-text-unofficial" *ngIf="!officialMempoolSpace">This website (the "Website") is an instance of the B1tpool explorer software. This Trademark Policy outlines the
      guidelines for using the B1tpool name and any associated logos if you are running an unofficial instance.</p>

    <h4 i18n="trademark-policy.general-guidelines-title">GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR USE OF B1tpool TRADEMARKS</h4>
    <p i18n="trademark-policy.general-guidelines-text-1">The B1tpool name and logos are trademarks of the B1tpool Project. We encourage the use of the B1tpool software
      and the B1tpool name to refer to it, provided that such use is fair and does not mislead consumers.</p>
    <p i18n="trademark-policy.general-guidelines-text-2">When referring to the software, please use the full name "B1tpool" where appropriate. You may use the name
      "B1tpool" to truthfully describe your instance of the software, for example, "My B1tpool Instance" or "B1tpool
      Explorer for Bit Testnet".</p>

    <h4 i18n="trademark-policy.prohibited-uses-title">PROHIBITED USES</h4>
    <p i18n="trademark-policy.prohibited-uses-text-1">You may not use the B1tpool trademarks in any way that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li i18n="trademark-policy.prohibited-use-1">Suggests affiliation, endorsement, or sponsorship by the B1tpool Project if none exists.</li>
      <li i18n="trademark-policy.prohibited-use-2">Is likely to cause confusion among users as to the source or origin of goods or services.</li>
      <li i18n="trademark-policy.prohibited-use-3">Disparages the B1tpool Project or its software.</li>
      <li i18n="trademark-policy.prohibited-use-4">Is unlawful or in connection with unlawful activities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p i18n="trademark-policy.prohibited-uses-text-2">You may not register domain names, social media accounts, or other brand identifiers that are confusingly similar to
      "B1tpool" or that incorporate the B1tpool trademarks in a way that suggests an official affiliation.</p>
    <p i18n="trademark-policy.prohibited-uses-text-3">If you are running an unofficial instance, you must make it clear that your instance is not the official B1tpool
      website. For example, by stating "This is an unofficial B1tpool instance for Bit."</p>

    <h4 i18n="trademark-policy.logo-usage-title">LOGO USAGE</h4>
    <p i18n="trademark-policy.logo-usage-text">If the B1tpool project provides official logos, you may use them to refer to the B1tpool software, provided such use
      complies with this policy. Do not alter the logos in any way.</p>

    <h4 i18n="trademark-policy.forks-title">FORKS AND MODIFIED VERSIONS</h4>
    <p i18n="trademark-policy.forks-text-1">The B1tpool software is open source. You are free to fork and modify the software under the terms of its license.
      However, if you distribute a modified version of the software, you should use a different name for your fork to
      avoid confusion with the official B1tpool project, unless your modifications are minor and do not fundamentally
      change the nature or branding of the software.</p>
    <p i18n="trademark-policy.forks-text-2">If you maintain a fork with significant changes, you must not use the B1tpool name or logos in a way that implies
      your fork is the official B1tpool project or is endorsed by it.</p>

    <h4 i18n="trademark-policy.reporting-abuse-title">REPORTING TRADEMARK ABUSE</h4>
    <p i18n="trademark-policy.reporting-abuse-text">If you become aware of any use of the B1tpool trademarks that violates this policy, please report it to us (e.g.,
      via GitHub issues for the B1tpool project if applicable).</p>

    <h4 i18n="trademark-policy.questions-title">QUESTIONS</h4>
    <p i18n="trademark-policy.questions-text">If you have any questions about this Trademark Policy or how to use the B1tpool trademarks, please contact us.</p>
